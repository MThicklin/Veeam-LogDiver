Main
Main takes the log file(s), splits it up, then passes them on to the other processes to work on.

Always had issue trying to get while loops to work, but I think it would be good here.
while True:
    count += 1
    logLines = log.readline()

    if not line:
        break

errors
Works but I need to figure out how I'm going to use it.

parseXML
Using https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xml-parsing-python/ as a guide

topSection
topSection pulls the data with Regex but it's not taking out the strings.

warning
Haven't started on warning but it's going to try and filter the different warnings out.

jobs
working to get the 'Current Jobs' section split into some form I can pass over to the job class.
