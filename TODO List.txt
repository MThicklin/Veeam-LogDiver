Main.py - to be re-named logdive.py
Main.py main purpose will be to take the log file(s), split it up, then passes them on to the other processes to work on.  Currently need to figure out why arguements aren't passing correctly.

Also: set up main with paths, one cycling through file in the directory and one for a single file name to pass

errors
Works but I need to figure out how I'm going to use it.

parseXML
Using https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/xml-parsing-python/ as a guide

topSection
topSection pulls the data with Regex but it's not taking out the strings.

warnings
main.py is currently written to pass the log to warnings for processing.  Still need to find a way to clear out the clientupdate warnings.

jobs
'Current jobs' section is now split up, but I need to find a way to process the job infomation into something useful.

vmc
Have the printing down pretty good need to read the lines and seperate what's xml, what can be a dictionary.
